NCharge has consistently delivered exceptional, reliable service that I count on (whether addressing anything electrical or specifically generator-related, to myself as a new owner).  I am fortunate to have found NCharge, won\u2019t go anywhere else!  Earlier comments:  Trouble shoot electrical panel fuse trip after lightening storm; identified problem with ground wire between multiple 3-way outlets, made repairs, communicated cause & remedies  & made repair.  I can\u2019t give NCharge a high enough rating; this is the second successful experience with them after the whole house generator installation.  One stop shopping for all your electrical needs, don\u2019t lose their number(!!!)",

We had an issue with the new doorbell after we had our security system installed.  I contacted Guy in reference to this issue and he was willing to come back out to our house to try and solve the problem without charging an additional service call fee. Turns out we needed to contact the security company to fix the issue over their app.  After I reached out to Guy to let him know he didn't have to come back he informed me that he also reached out to the security company and that it would be a simple fix on their part. I believe he went over and beyond his duty in this and provided excellent customer service. We will use him again for any future electrician work necessary.",

        "text": "R&R was called by in our neighborhood association to troubleshoot the LED lights not working at our subdivision entranceway. Prior to being called we had replaced the old flood lighting at the entranceway with new LED lights which were very expensive. We did this ourselves. That lighting worked well for a couple of months and then the lights would go out when it rained. This was due to poor and damaged conduit ( approx 30 feet ) that needed to be replaced. The wiring and conduit was damaged due to constant replanting and fertilizer over the years. When we received the bill from R&R after the repair  it was excessive. To the tune of $1200 !! They had not only charged us for new conduit and wiring they had charged us for NEW LED lights ( on both sides of the road.) and a new new photo cell which were all newly replaced just a couple of\nmonths before !  We contacted the owner and asked why they had replaced the lights which were new ! The owner said they had replaced the lights because they were told to do so. I asked, \u201c Well, did ya think to test the light to see if it worked since they looked new ?? \u201c. He said \u201c Nope, we just replaced them because we were told to replace them\u201d. This is a flat out lie. The person that called them for the repair knew the lights were new and would have never told him that. If this was a quality contractor protecting the best interests of the customer they would have tested those lights to see if they worked since they obviously looked NEW ! Plus the RAAB lighting we installed prior to them coming was under warranty!! Word advice, Don\u2019t use them.",

He found the leak and got it fixed in no time!\nI will be doing a remodeling job very soon and electrical repairs. I have no doubt Dominique will do a fantastic job with those two separate projects of mine too. I really am looking forward to working with him on getting it done.

They came and installed the doorbell and fixed my dishwasher in no time. There was an issue with the thermostat not having any power and Isreal recommended someone who came the next day and got it done for a reasonable price. He also advised me on my ceiling fan replacement and I'm so thankful to him because he could've just installed what I had without caring if it would be the best fit. I will definitely be using them for all of my repairs. They're reliable, affordable, and they care about their customers needs.",

Not only did they do a GREAT job on the repairs, but they went even deeper and identified the root cause of my problem and fixed it too.  Many repair people would have just fixed what I asked and left, and not address the root cause.  This would've resulted in additional repairs in the future.  If I could give 'One Thousand Duties. LLC' a 10, I would.  They were Very professional, they came in and went straight to work. I would highly recommend One Thousand Duties, LLC to anyone.  You won't be disappointed.",

We had gotten a different plumber to look at the issue a few days prior and he had quoted me almost 2k to fix the issue. Snipes came out and fixed the issue for $160!! Technician that came out was super quick and very knowledgeable about what he was doing! If we ever have another issue I will 100% call Snipes again! Thank you all so much!",

After I paid them for their work I realized that they had not subtracted this discount. When I asked them about this, their response was essentially 'You didn't mention the promotion at the right time, but we will let you try again next time.'",

We were very specific on the phone that payment was to be handled over the phone by us, and to not even bother her at all. but instead two strange men knocked on her door and proceeded to stand in her home for almost 45 minutes while frequently reminding her that every moment they were there would cost more money. When payment was finally handled, one of the men chose to share that he served 2 years in prison. That combined with his rude demeanor severely frightened her and she ended up not feeling comfortable spending the night in her own home.

He was very easy to communicate with for the appointment, contacted me the morning of the appointment and  his navigation system gave up-to-the minute arrival details.  He had all the necessary parts needed and worked with me for the best placement of the box.  He was efficient and left the area cleaner than it was when he arrived.\n\nI used A-1 a couple of years ago for a problem in the same out-building.  Turned out to be a loose breaker.  Didn't have a problem  with his service then either - which is why I called him for my new circuit.\n\nI've been thinking about going solar and found out Leonard is also very knowledgeable about solar. After he installed my RV circuit we discussed what would be needed and a very rough estimate so I could get an idea of the costs.  If/when I decide to make the Solar plunge I'll be calling Leonard for a more comprehensive estimate. I've spoken to a Solar Company in Birmingham and they were a joke.  Their prices were outrageous and got to the point they wouldn't return phone calls.  I got the complete opposite with A-1.\n\nLeonard is no nonsense and ethical and will tell you like it is.  If he sees a problem or something unsafe he'll tell you.\n\nI'm fairly new to the Cullman area and have had problems finding good contractors/plumbers/electricians.  A-1 is my go to Company for any electrical work needed.",

Leonard came out and found problems, including a dangerous issue.  The last time he came, Leonard was at our house all day, even a couple of hours into the evening, until he completed the work.  We feel he cares about doing an excellent job. He is our go to electrician.",

Leonard replaced the breaker box and meter box. He was always professional, corteous, on time, and explained everything he did. A couple of weeks later our water heater broke. He came back out for free and after proving the problem wasn't related to his work, he recommended replacing the water heater, and explained how to do it. I decided instead to replace the heating element, since a new element would only cost $20. Leonard spent half of Sunday walking me through on the phone how to replace it, and now I have hot water again. I will continue to use Leonard for any electrical issues.",

Almost all of my basement electrical work was already in place because I was putting a one bedroom apartment in where a one bedroom apartment used to be. I simply needed some finishing work done. After he left he called the city to request they put a stop work order on me. The City inspector was at my house within 15 minutes. It turned out to be the best thing he could've done for me. The city inspector told me neither my breaker box nor my outside meter needed replacing. They did not put a stop work order on me because almost all my electrical work was pre-existing. Turns out A1 was just feeding me a line to run up a huge estimate for things that did not need replacing. They'll never get my business. They aren't trustworthy and they're willing to tell you things need replacing when they don't just to run up the bill. His estimate to finish wiring 2 rooms where most of the electrical was already in place from the previous apartment was almost 5k. I'm really glad the inspector came out and let me know most of the estimate wasn't required to pass an inspection. I'm now free to find an honest electrician. I plan to call a couple of them on Monday. If this guy gives you an estimate plz be sure to get a second opinion. It could save you thousands.",

We had a lightning claim at our home that caused extensive damage to our panel box, wiring, applicances, etc.  (Our home is a 100-year-old home that probably needed some updating in the electrical and plumbing areas, frankly).  I had heard nothing but rave reviews about Semi-Retiired Electrician, so I contacted him.  Mr. Turgeon's response time was surprisingly fast.  He was courteous and punctual...two of the things that rate highly with me.  I was also impressed with his ability to assess the damage and explain how he would make repairs that would be BETTER THAN the existing electrical codes.  He began work at our home the next day because we were completely without electricity.  As he worked, I had the opportunity to talk with him and was further impressed to know that he is a retired electrical engineer that just loves to work rather than live the retired life.  The entire job lasted about three days (but he got the electricity back on the first day, thankfully!).  As he would find wires, junction boxes, splices, etc. that were fire hazards or \"out of code\", he would fix them...with my prior consent, of course.  I'll never forget what the county electrical inspector said when I called to schedule the inspection of Mr. Turgeon's work.  He asked who the contractor was, and I told him Semi-Retired Electrician.  He said, \"Well, it won't take long to inspect.  He does excellent work.\"  I agree.I would definitely recommend him to any and everyone.",

I guess they stood on it instead of using a ladder. When we opened the box to move the range we saw the glass surface was cracked and the legs were broken. I called Tyler several times and other people answered the phone, but never called me back. If he has insurance, this is what it's for, so it shouldn't be a big deal. He lost all my trust.",

My only complaint is that it took a few weeks because it was a rental home and not a primary resident. I believe in first come, first serve since we pay the same price as everyone else. But once I pointed that out they had someone there within a few days! Very happy with the service once we cleared up the expectation of priority. I was recommended them by someone else and I will definitely recommend them to others!",

We were told by the phone companies they don't do repairs on inside lines anymore and that electricians now have to do that. So I stopped in at Univeristy Electric on Monday and talked to them about this. They were so nice and said they would be glad to come out and fix it. That they would put us on the wait list and call when they had an opening. Tuesday morning at 8:15am I got a call from them that they could come out this morning if it was ok with us. Wow, that was fast. So Thomas came out to see what needed to be done to fix the issue, got the right stuff, spent a couple of hours running a new line and fixed our issue. Thomas was very nice, friendly and professional. He checked several other things dealing with the phone connection. He made sure we were happy with everything and also made us aware of other services that available through his company. So have no doubts we will definitely use them again!! So thanks a lot University Electrical for your help.\nRick & Lisa Breeden",

A-1 did the wiring.  They only followed the electrical plans provided by the builder. Issues we had with lighting were due to the fans having remotes and not traditional pull chords. I never knew that could make a difference in how the ceiling fans operated.\n\nAt any rate, A-1 sent out one of their electrical supervisors. He replaced an outlet for me and replaced a suspected \u201cweak\u201delectrical relay with no issues. Phillip also explained everything to me, then relayed my concerns to the company management.\n\nThe owners reached out to me and have agreed to work with me to resolve my issues and get things the way I want. I had a long talk with the owner and she is genuine and truly wants to do the right thing. Thank you team A-1!!  I\u2019m more than satisfied with the results.  \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e",

I had several warranty repair visits to correct the problems over the past year; but, still have outdoor outlets having issues. This will be the 3rd or 4th time one of the outlets have malfunctioned. I called today to request yet another repair visit and was told that they won't warranty their repair from the last time. The manager/owner was extremely rude, loud, and condescending. I literally asked her to slow down so I could could try to understand what she was saying. She argued that she already repeated herself a couple of times and that I was asking the same question. This manager/owner needs to take a phone etiquette class and learn how to talk to customers. She was out of line with me and has lost a good customer.

Long story short the guy that came out from A 1 was fast very friendly and more than knowledgeable and helpful. Every experience is different but for me it was great...

My kids are grown and I work long hours so the home has little usage/traffic.  I don't even cook!  Just recently, the pantry light stopped working.  I called A-1 Electric and was told that it was out of warranty.  True by about a few weeks.  I was also quickly told by the VP that the problem could not have been caused by A-1 since it had been working for a year and it had to have been caused by another contractor.  Seems like a convenient response to avoid taking responsibility.  No one has touched the electrical system since I moved in and now my pantry lighting does not work.  I would have thought A-1 would stand by their work.   Of course, they offered to come out in 3 weeks at a service charge of $125.\n\nVery disappointing...To regain service,  the wire will have to be replaced.\nWith no easy access to the attic, sheetrock will need to be cut, repaired, and painted with an estimate of over $1000.

I refused to sign a payment plan he had proposed due to the fact that not only had I not agreed to it , I could not even tell what work he completed. in a few days I was summoned to small claims court. I received a lien on my house. Small claims court could not detemine my word against his so ruled amount to be cut in half. . I have not been able to come up with my half  and now a sheriff has been sending notices of removal of assets.

I tried another company that told me the stains on my pool liner was \"unlike anything he's ever seen,\" and I \"should consider replacing my liner.\" Mr. Moore assured me that the stain was only algae and he could get it removed and pool ready for swimming asap. They did exactly that. Every homeowner needs a trustworthy handyman this is why I HIGHLY recommend Moorer's handyman services.",

Mr Charles stopped first and recommended Shade Tree Mechanic Reggie.  They worked together to fetch a replacement alternator from 30 miles away, towed the car to a rough location but quickly installed the new alternator.  We had impending rainstorms coming in, and did this swap by flashlight finishing up at 10pm.  No other repair place would have stuck with this so late.  Reggie got us back on the road for a fair price.  He accepted cash or credit.  His final price was less than the first quote and I feel he did not take advantage of our predicament.

When we called to pick it up he tried to charge over $200 for storage.  This morning I go to get something from my center console and notice it had been rifled through and items are missing.",

We've found Francis and Skillset Solutions to be very professional - excellent communication, adhering to a promised schedule and performing the work thoroughly (including, without prompting, identifying and cleaning up workmanship deficiencies caused by other contractors).  They've demonstrated to us the willingness and ability to take on a wide variety of residential jobs, and we'll definitely reach out to them for help with other repair and maintenance needs in the future.",

        "text": "Day Plumbing was very responsive and professional, and provided services at a reasonable price.  Our main line was clogged and Day Plumbing returned our call the next day after we called and came out that afternoon. Danny and a Jimmy was a welcome site and got to work right away to unblock the clogged drain line. After the first pass, they waited around to ensure the clog was cleared, but it started backing up again.  So they ran their equipment again and cleared the line again. Said it was because of the heating and cooling of the grease in the line that it sometimes causes repeated clearing. After running hot water down the drain for an extended period of time, the drain appears to be working fine. While waiting to ensure water didn\u2019t back up again, Danny and Jimmy went the extra mile and cleaned our bathroom and shower drains as I was concerned they might be getting clogged up. All in all, they did a great job and at a reasonable cost, and were very timely with coming out to fix the drain. Oh, would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention great customer service that Jeanette provided over the phone. Thank you Day Plumbing.",

        "text": "We have had problems with water pressure at our Lake Martin cabin for years.  A local plumbing company came out a few months ago and couldn\u2019t find the problem.  They just gave up, but things got worse to where we barely had a trickle of water at times.  I contacted a large plumbing company in Montgomery, but they recommended Danny Day and told me he does quality work at a price that would be considerably lower than theirs.  How right they were.  He persisted until he found and replaced a faulty pressure regulator and also found and repaired a long-standing leak in a copper pipe.  Our water pressure is now better than it has ever been.  His charge was considerably less than I was expecting and probably a third of what one of the large companies would have charged.  He is an old-fashioned plumber who treats his customers the way he would want to be treated.  I recommend him highly.",

Today is Monday and they were here at 9am to put the part on. They under-promised and over-delivered!

He identified the problem, repaired it and restored water to the home. If you ever need a plumber in the Wetumpka area DO NOT hesitate to call Bishop Plumbing. Repair cost for coming out on a Saturday was very reasonable.\n\n(Note: I did call several other companies, but weekend service was limited or didn't have the man power to support)\n\nHis customer service, promptness, clear explanation of repair to include the root  cause of the damage showed me how he takes pride in his work and cares for his customers. Additionally, well explained how to avoid this damage from happening again.\n\nHis professionalism and customer acknowledgement and passion for his craft should be the standard for the industry.\n\nThis was my 1st time experience with James Bishop and I can't thank him enough. So, for  all my plumbing needs in the future will be with this company.",

He did go above, and beyond to make me happy, and taken care of. I ended up tipping him 20 because he turned around after being gone to help me figure out why my well pump wasn't working. So, maybe you have to get the right guy? I dunno. Above all my problem was fixed in a timely manner, and my house was back to operational. For that, I say thank you!",

Dale's Septic recommended Mr Peavy, and he came out the same day because it was a holiday weekend and we were worried about making it worse. He found roots in the structure of our pipes, something that I feel like should have been identified pretty early on in the diagnosis process, but was missed repeatedly by the other company. He was also able to confirm that are upstairs plumbing ties in further down the line, therefore we could continue to use it without messing anything up. Gave us peace of mind which I greatly appreciate. Will be using him for the repair during off-season. Highly recommend!",

Their pricing structure might be a little unique, but I've been a dedicated client for 15 years at two different homes in Montgomery. It usually requires a bit of discussion. Austin, the plumber on the ground, offers a price range, but Cesar, the manager, makes the final tweaks over the phone as you start to dissect the cost per service/item. Once you get past that, you'll struggle to find a team with a more extensive toolkit at their disposal. On one occasion, I had three vans of plumbers at my property. So, you definitely receive value for your investment. It's a relationship based on mutual understanding. Despite the initial hurdles, I wouldn't want anyone else handling my plumbing needs. If you're okay with asking questions and putting in some effort, these guys, under new management now, will undoubtedly exceed your expectations.",

They tidied up the area nicely and inspected all the pipes and faucets thoroughly. It was reassuring to have plumbers who were competent and willing to go above and beyond to satisfy their client. They were so excellent, I wished I could have given them some gift cards for dinner! I also had another gentleman from Roy's Plumbing Repairs come out to inspect my outdoor faucet in Montgomery.

I had asked him about using a camera for the inspection, as I was informed that it was included in the price. Austin explained that he didn't have the camera with him, but assured me that either he or Cesar would return later that day or by Monday at the latest to complete the task. Under their new management, Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical has made great strides in customer service and I received a prompt follow-up call to ensure everything was in order. Their commitment to delivering quality plumbing services in Montgomery is truly commendable.",

He was tenacious about getting the problem resolved when we ran into a few roadblocks and made sure I understood what was happening every step of the way. Pricing was beyond fair and we will definitely be calling on him in the future for any other appliance needs. Fantastic service and a business with true integrity.... Something that's hard to find these days. I highly recommend!",

It was making a loud squeaking noise and banging a little but still drying   Mark said he had a full day but would work us in and wanted us to send a picture of the serial # so he could make sure to have the parts he needed. 3 hours later he called and said he was on the way if that was convenient for us. Mark showed up with his Dr. Appliance lab coat on and was one of the friendliest, cordial, mannerly, professional, and efficient people of have ever met   The charge was so affordable I will definitely recommend Mark to everyone I know!!  It was a pleasure meeting him and will definitely call him when and if we need to",

(It wasn\u2019t the compressor.)\nMy wife and I were very impressed with Mark's knowledge, skills and professionalism. I also liked that Mark was a Veteran.\nWe thought our only recourse was to buy a new refrigerator before Dr Appliance quickly fix ours. We also thought his charges were reasonable and fair.\nWould we recommend Dr Appliance? YES!

        "text": "Worse experience ever! Had issue with my garage after his crew left from doing drywall project . I contacted him to let him know my garage was not opening and could one of his guys maybe touched something by accident since he was working in the area . He immediately got offended and said that was impossible. He started over talking me as I was trying to explain to him that I just got my garage doors repaired a couple of months ago and had no problem with it until today. Then he proceeded to ask me to give him the name of person that repaired my garage as if I was lying . Then told me what he did for me was for free. He ended up getting cursed out because he thought he could talk to me any kind of way and kept over talking me as if I was trying to get free services. Told me it was free and he would take it as a loss and he wasn\u2019t hurting for nothing. He lied and said I cursed his crew out and I was nothing but nice to them . He sent his crew back to my home and told them to collect their things and they weren\u2019t coming back the next day . Starting bragging about they were the top crew in the area and yet left my home a mess. He told me he didn\u2019t need my money and they would move on . I asked him how much do I owe him and he said nothing and I can pay him if I felt like it. Unbelievable!  Most arrogant person I\u2019ve ever met. Kept changing his prices . Text me and told me to make sure I put in reviews that I cursed him out and it didn\u2019t cost me anything. This guy is a piece of work . He got back exactly what he gave me. Good luck with this one . Mind you I have all of the text messages. Also, he tried to make his texts sound professional but his conversation over the phone was rude , loud and arrogant. I\u2019m sure there are other business that provide excellent services. You got back what you gave to me. Nothing but a Wolfe in sheep\u2019s clothing. Lesson learned. Make sure you get everything in writing before you deal with this guy. He just throws out prices . Since you told me my services was free and you will count is as a loss, so be it . Cause it was a loss . Dont you ever accuse me of trying not to pay you ! I\u2019m not wanting for nothing either Mr. OK fist of all Mr! I font smoke weed or any other substance. So it will wise not to slander my name . You a the fool and idiot . You started off by cursing me. In fact you acted like your were on a substance. My home is very clean and I don\u2019t allow shoes or smoking in my home for your information . Your worker damaged my garage and you started yelling at me suggesting that I wasn\u2019t going to pay you . I have every right to inquire about damages to my home your worker caused it . And your workers smelled like alcohol. You are a poor example of a business person and you are most definitely a compulsive liar. Look how you respond to all your negative reviews. You think you can talk to people any kind of way but you found the right one . I was reciprocating the energy you gave me you narcissistic sociopath. Just like a coward to respond to a review with lies to justify your ignorance. You are lucky I don\u2019t file suit against you for slander! And if I did smoke it\u2019s  home! You have some see personality flaws . And yes your guys left my home a mess. Trying to suggest my home was nasty. You can eat off my floors idiot . AND YOU ARE A RACIST NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!  If it act and quacks like a duck it is a duck.  Now you can take this message and put it on your pipe  and smoke it. I think you need rehab.  AND YEAH YOUR SERVICE SUCKS ! You are liar incompetent and a complete fooI!  I wouldn\u2019t recommend you to a blind person. AND I DONT HAVE TO LIE ABOUT SO CALLED COMPANY. Trust believe and receive I\u2019ll say it again ! DONG YOU EVER LIE AND SAY MY HOME SMELLED LIKE WEED. Would no one in their right mind put up with your arrogance and loud mouth. You found the right one. You chose not to get paid and I never refused to pay you! Better check your email sociopath bragging about how rich you are! Spoiled BRAT! Don\u2019t make me email. You had to much Bugga Suga that day. U are a narcissistic sociopath.",

From start to finish Slade was a man of his word unlike multiple other Montgomery contractors who I have been burned by. He made it clear to expect some touch up needed and until I was satisfied he sent his crew everyday until it was up to my standards. He also tried to save me money with different ways of doing things which is unheard of which I truly appreciated. I will be using him for all my jobs going forward and he is a gem for this area.

After the repair, the tenants of the home sent us pictures showing the repair which appeared to be low quality and the texture was not even similar. I understand it won't be exact, but this isn't even close. We contacted him and he said he would go out and do a better job with the texture and he asked us to go ahead and pay him. We paid him and now he won't return our calls or texts and of course has not went back out to do the job correctly. I guess I should have read the other review on here talking about how he will ghost you as soon as he is paid. The attached picture will show you the level of quality you should expect from this business.\n\nedit: We called you and left a message and after 12 days got no reply. The tenant called you three separate times and left messages and got no reply. The tenants are given the option to schedule service since it is their schedule we need to work around. We of course find and pay for services. I paid you because you promised you would go fix the repair you made. I have text messages to prove that you asked for payment prior to going back out and completing the repair. I appreciate that you found the time to interact after a negative review, I just wish it was sooner and on better terms. Your response to this review was harsh and I find it insulting to be called a liar and a shame. I should have read the other negative reviews so I could see how you talk to your clients. I hope that consumers will be able to see the way you respond to unhappy customers.

The repair ended up not being as extensive as he originally thought and therefore much cheaper than his first quote. I believe his pricing was very fair. His helpers were professional and did excellent work on repair and painting. I would absolutely use his services again and recommend him for his honesty, quality, and punctuality.",

They showed up on time, and did a dream job on my bedroom floor installing large slate tiles.  I have recommended him and his crew at my workplace as someone to use as well and they are on our list of people to call!  No contractor nightmares here!  They will earn their money and your business and do right by you!  I plan to hire them to work on my bathroom remodel next.  I am extremely particular about quality of work on my home, and they lived up to my expectations!",

They got no paint on the brick of the house and it looks brand new. They  even painted the garage door. The owner stated they were starting a power wash business as well and quoted me a price for my driveway and stone walkway. They pressure washed my driveway and walkway and it looks just like the concrete's been poured. What a face lift. They started at 8:00 a.m. and finished by 4:30. I highly recommend them",

I did not hear from anyone until I reached out to check why no one had shown up.\nEven after the initial incident, I decided to go forward with them and scheduled a date for them to come in and work on my house. And once again, they did not show up for the date! When I reached out to them and questioned them why they hadn't shown up, they told me that they had thought we had set it up for another day. They asked if it was possible to reschedule for a later date that week. Once that date arrived, I got a notification from their team that they had an emergency and would communicate with me later to reschedule once again. It has been a couple of weeks and I still have not heard from them.\n\nI would not recommend this company to anyone based on my experience.",

They provided a detailed estimate, outlining the scope of the work, costs, and a reasonable timeline for completion. This level of transparency was greatly appreciated.\n\nHe arrived on time, and his work was nothing short of impeccable. They took great care to ensure that the new plugs were not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The attention to detail was evident, and the finished work blended seamlessly with my home's existing electrical setup.\n\nWhat truly sets them apart is their commitment to customer satisfaction. They went above and beyond to answer my questions and address any concerns I had during and after the installation.\n\nIn summary, Bledsoe\u2019s Electrical exceeded my expectations in every aspect of the plug installation. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and dedication to customer satisfaction make them the go-to choice for electrical work.

He set off to investigate, and within about 20 minutes, he said he knew what the problem was and got to work.\nThere were wires crossed and bad grounds all over the house. He has been out several times now and has fixed so much bad wiring, run new wires, put in a new panel, added new circuits, etc.\nI can\u2019t say enough how grateful we are to have found him.",

He's so calm cool and collect straight cut about 50 years old never said one bad word all positive and he was here for about 12 hours took a 30 minute lunch break is all he did. This was a major job This was not a minor little job. Mr Phill Pate took pride in his work and I consider Phill a new friend. It's someone you would like to be around. He also put up with my yapping dog all day. Cleaned up all the messes and the price I didn't even call anybody else I was very satisfied with the price.

        "text": "I had the owner come out to my home to give me an estimate on my electrical work. It involved installing commercial grade LED lighting in a renovation project I have been working on. He came out and provided a quote the next day. He assured me he knew how to complete this job and had experience. The next day I had 3 guys show up who had no idea how to do anything with LED lighting. They were asking me questions how to wire it up even after I handed them instructions from everything. They said they were done in 4 hours. When I turned on my LED lights in the master bedroom they were strobing and flickering. The crew left anyway after showing them this. I didn't feel so great about it and had more electrical work to be completed but I was waiting on items to arrive in the mail. I called another electrician out and he went through everything. The flickering with the LED lights was from a ground not connected in the light switch box in the bedroom. The power supplies in the attic to the LEDs were wired wrong entirely. The power inverter to power the wall control panel had wiring going to a power supply which should have never happened. The power supplies have their own dedicated power already in the attic within a few feet and this was explained several times. The crew did not appear to be legitimate electricians and I ended up paying another electrician double to come back and fix the mess they installed. The electrician that came out actually knew how to install LED lighting. I contacted Mr. Beasley about the installation through text message explaining my situation with no response. I gave him the opportunity to make it right. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE A JOKE.\n\nMr. Beasley, this review will cost you more business than if you had just made it right.\nThanks",

Unfortunately, my most recent experience was the exact opposite. I don\u2019t know if there was a misunderstanding regarding what materials would be available at our house, but Chris chose to get an attitude with me instead of trying to find out what happened. I had simply asked him to come troubleshoot a light in our laundry room and I did not know if we had a wiring problem or what parts might be required to either repair the existing fixture or replace it with a new one. Chris said it was an old fixture and needed to be replaced and that he doesn\u2019t keep them in his truck. I told him I could go pick one up and he clearly became frustrated that we didn\u2019t already have one. He said \u201cthis is messed up\u201d and \u201cwe drove a long way out here\u201d. That\u2019s when I said I\u2019d pay him for a service call so they can be on their way. I don\u2019t understand how someone could be so unprofessional with a long standing and well established customer. Sorry Chris but you lost me as a customer today.",

        "text": "Ronnie & Tyler are lifesavers.  Friday before Memorial Day my electrician cancelled on me. I was in the process of completing my outdoor kitchen and needed the wiring done before the granite was placed on Friday afternoon.\n\nThey were booked up but Ronnie agreed to swing by and see if anything could be done.  In 3 hours, they had run all the wires and set the key outlets so that the work could continue.  Because of their work, my kitchen was completed enough that we could enjoy the new grill for Memorial Day weekend.  They will be back this week to finish trimming out the remaining outlets and installing the lights that i purchased over the weekend.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about them.  Heck, they even called me on Saturday night to make sure that everything was good!!",

I have read some of the other reviews from Mr. Cook and seems like he is a fair weather reviewer. If it isn\u2019t to his liking then he will post a negative review. I am not well off and Mr.Clem has always treated my wife and I with respect and has done excellent work. He helps you figure an issue without all the oversell like the big name companies do. I would recommend Mr. Clem to anyone. I don\u2019t like a negative posting when no work was done and it was because someone\u2019s feelings got hurt.",

Hey I have been a landlord for over 20 yrs and I have had rental property in the best of areas and the worst but in all and all money is money no matter what area as long as it is legal, so for him to say that and not respond I would have to give him a zero rating, I tell you that you can leave in a 300k area and if someone wants to do a crime to you or the area they will not think twice. They will just do it.  But again with this statement I feel that his services are better given to the more well off customers, so I would not recommend this company at all.  I will keep my money in my pocket and find another company to work with.",

I knew before the very first call to Tristan that the clogged toilet was old and probably just needed to be replaced. But when I had to call him a second time to come unclog the toilet, I knew that it was just time to replace it. I talked to him about installing a new toilet, got a quote, and expected to have to wait at least a week or more before he would be able to get back out to put in the new toilet, but nope! He was back two days later and had the new toilet installed in a little more than an hour! I would not hesitate to recommend him to family, friends, and strangers. I\u2019ll definitely call on him any time I have other plumbing needs!",

Tristan and Nathaniel arrived 30-45 minutes after I called the office. They were super friendly and professional, and prioritized my situation due to the water leaking all over my floors. They made sure I understood all my options clearly before drafting my invoice. Once the paperwork was done they got to work immediately. Even though my situation was a little more complex than the average swap out, they problem solved quickly and got everything installed within a few hours, and took the time to show me how everything worked. They even had to reconfigure my washer and dryer set up to accommodate the new water heater, and they didn\u2019t leave until they ensured everything was working as it should for me. I\u2019ll be recommending them to anyone I know with plumbing issues and I\u2019ll be a return customer in the future for sure! Thanks again Tristan and Nathaniel!",

Hire Shane for all your electricity needs and I promise that you won't regret it! If I could give more stars, I would. Shane won't let you down and he is very honest about his work. I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a real deal and licensed electrician.",

My sump pump was not working, he identified the problem quickly. My float had gone bad, he replaced the float with one he had at his shop so there was no ordering parts. Works perfectly now, he even took the time to fix one of my toliets. He was very professional and just a really nice guy. The price was better than I expected especially with the time and effort it took. Will definitely be using his services in the future.",

They overcharge, knowing they can, because most of their work is in Birmingham. They say they are with Salser Plumbing, but they ask for checks to be made out to their own names. I just spoke directly with Salser and he did admit recommending Clay to me and giving me his number. Yet Salser denies any responsibility for Clay\u2019s work or his associates. I can not verify the quality of work that Salser does, they have yet to come out to service us. I would say make sure you are calling Salser. Also, I cannot emphasize the importance of educating yourself on plumbing repairs.  Watch a YouTube video and do it yourself before you let Clay or Rich handle anything but snaking out a line. Do it yourself, if possible. We found ourselves in a tragic circumstance with this last repair, Clay and his associate did not come through, yet demanded payment before we could even get home from our grandson\u2019s funeral to check the repair, which was not done properly or according to our specific instructions. It is now leaking copiously again, as we told them it would. I hope to give Salser themselves a chance to redeem their good name. Mr Salser states he will no longer recommend Clay. I hope he doesn\u2019t.",

They were asked to add an outlet in the hallway of this home and they used a hammer to knock a hole in the paneling and just shoved an outlet in the hole without a junction box and they connected the outlet to a circuit that was ungrounded so he cut the ground wire out and didn\u2019t gfi protect it. This guy made many, many other code violations in this house. And I would be surprised if this person were actually licensed with the state. If they are licensed they need to be reported to the state board of licenses for official review. Anyone who willfully violates Electrical codes with this much reckless abandon and actually charges people for it needs to be run out of business. I say all of this because I am a state licensed master electrician and I was called in to clean up this guys mess.",

Not only was he willing to meet me that morning, but he also uncovered an issue that the previous company did not spot. Thanks to them, I was able to factor this into negotiations for closing. Both Kris and the guy who helped him with the sewer scope were super professional and nice. I will definitely reach out to them to fix the issues in the next few weeks.

We will pass this down to family and friends and tell them not to use you guys. Also the last 2 review comments is from someone in the company anyway so of course the comments are going be positive.

He was willing to come out to my home and do an estimate, where others gave me nothing but excuses as to why they could not.  All the better because Jamie's work was excellent!  I needed auxiliary power ran out to my work shed and a receptacle for a portable generator on the side of my house.  I now have power out in my shed and I can now roll up my Pulsar 12,000 Watt Portable Generator and plug into my house without having to run a bunch of extension cords.  We are so happy knowing we are now totally prepared for a power outage.  I will definitely use Jamie and his crew for future projects.  Thank you!",

Based on their experience, Apgar offered me a unique solution to enhance my system performance beyond my initial request. Finally, Apgar provided service according to my schedule without delays and was very efficient in execution.\n\nThank you, Apgar; in a rural area experiencing skilled labor shortages and typical long wait times for help, it was refreshing to work with a company that delivered services quickly and professionally.\n\nDr. Pete Garcia",

A mans word is his bond, and he lied like he was going to do the job and never did it - got a 250$ deposit up front for materials he claimed he needed. He asked for 130$ for more supplies and stuff. Didn\u2019t finish the job and never answers the phone again. Do NOT hire this unreliable man who steals from hard working people.",

I will continue to be a long time customer and would recommend them to anyone. As others have mentioned when you call their business number you do get a voice mail greeting that instructs you to call Lance and gives you another phone number to call, so just have a pen and paper handy. Lance will call you back within a reasonable amount of time and is so easy to talk to. Just make sure you don't miss his call! I made that mistake the first time I needed them and missed the first opening they had to come out. They are very good and very busy and since I missed his call he moved on to the next customer on his list.  I had to wait a couple days because I missed out but I understood and it was fine because it wasn't an emergency. Both times they came out Brian was my service provider. He is very nice and so knowledgeable and also very easy to talk to! He will tell you the best options for your issues, where the best deals are and what to buy if it makes more sense to do so, and will give great advice for any questions you have. Their prices are also very very very reasonable and they do not take advantage of people. We had an extra electrical line installed and it was run through our attic to the outside and it looks so good that you would think the house was built with it originally. I also had him do some work under my kitchen sink and his assistant that came out with him vacuumed the debris in the cabinet when they were done! I was very impressed. His work is top notch and their customer service is fantastic.",

The wire was ran from the house to the old well and from the old well to the new well.  The old well\u2019s wiring was bad, which we didn\u2019t no still existed.

The man that did the repair reassured me that he was going to do all he could to get it taken care of as soon as possible, because he understands I have a small child at home and being without water isn't an option.\n\nThis was my first experience having to use a plumber but they have def won my business for life.

The very next day, no electricity.  I contacted Mikes Plumbing & Electric, as I was told to do, and spoke with their \"Secretary\" and was spoken too like I was a complete and utter idiot, which I can assure you, I am not.  She was rude, totally lacking in customer service skills, and I was left feeling like, well unless my house has absolutely no electricity, we're not interested.  If it works again when we come out, we will just leave again, as there is nothing we can do?????  The next appointment they had, would be next week Wednesday, and that was giving grudgingly.

They haven't done anything that I would deem worthy of the term \"investigating\" other than taking off a few switch covers and saying,\"everything looks fine\". (It's not). I've made videos of the flickering and noise, and have requested that they actually look at a panel or something. I'm not pleased.\n\nResponsiveness:\n\nIt's impossible to get them to call you back when they tell you that they will, and at this point I'm not calling again. They were supposed to be calling the electric company for me, and after two weeks of waiting, I decided to call the power company, which they said mike's service never called them. No surprise.\n\nConclusion and next steps:\n\nI didn't want to pay Vinson Electric to do the job because their rates are a little higher, but if I can get the job done before my house burns down, it's worth the safety of my family.",

I was referred to A+ through my home warranty, Old Republic, for a broken dishwasher.\n\nMike's initial response was great, allowing me to file the claim with the home warranty for a replacement dishwasher. From there, everything went downhill.\n\nMike told me he wouldn't install the dishwasher unless I sent him an extra $150 for electrical work that he claimed the home warranty wouldn't cover. This is to do electric work with the dishwasher install. He determined this was necessary without removing the old dishwasher or examining the current electrical situation. He wanted me to send him the extra money without providing me an invoice and before he would do the work. I called the Home Warranty company and they said they would approve it as long as he requested it.\n\nHe marked the service complete before it was completed and accepted payment from the home warranty company without installing the new dishwasher or removing the old one.\n\nWhen he finally went to the house to install the dishwasher, he said he couldn't do it because there was quarter round below the dishwasher and he wouldn't touch it. He told me he knew about this when he first went to the property weeks prior, just didn't bother to tell me. It would take him another week to get back to the house. When I asked him if a certain day of the week would work with his schedule, he snapped at me and told him he couldn't provide that information to me and said he would get there when he gets there.\n\nI removed the quarter round. At this point, the home warranty company sent him a letter stating he had to either complete the job or return the money. He came by and installed the dishwasher and placed the old one on the curb. He is responsible for haulaway but refuses to do it. He said he would only do it if the home warranty company explicitly told him to do so. I told him I would call the home warranty company and they would call him shortly.\n\nHe is refusing to answer calls from the home warranty company now. He told me he doesn't have time to get to it for several weeks.\n\nHe doesn't give appointment times, he just shows up when it is convenient for him. He complained about personal problems and how they are affecting his ability to do his job or make appointments. He is extremely unprofessional. If I could rate him less than 1 star, I would. Save yourself the headache and go elsewhere.\n\nTristate appliance has been incredible, if you want a local recommendation. I normally use them for everything. The only reason I went elsewhere was because the home warranty covered it.",

He said well your warranty company will make you provide one so I can go up there. So he kept saying pressures are off and I don\u2019t have stuff to fix it .  I said ok.  So he put Freon in it and I gave him his money and told him I will call someone else.  Needless to say I had him taken off my warranty list of ppl to come to my house.

Over a dollar a day to run a fridge and yet still almost a $10.00 fee every month for there service....so in total almost $280.00 in electric alone....and this is on a cheap month....Covington is lucky there the only provider in the area because I do not recommend them.",

He also told me that if my car was towed on a friday then he would let me get it saturday. Didnt understand why I couldn't get it tomorrow.

Our house is only 2 yrs old, but the outlets in the kitchen kept melting if more than one gadget was running at the same time. He ran some type of higher voltage wiring and now we have more designated circuits. He also installed a garbage disposal and wired an electrical outlet for it and then installed an outdoor fan.

        "text": "I spent $400 in August to have 2 10' sections of pipe replaced in an accessible crawlspace.\nAfter a month of low pressure and warm water, I called to ask why they ran 1/2\u201d PEX between two 3/4\u201d pipes, dropping my pressure. He told me to clean my shower head. My next gas bill is 3X as high, and I'm using much more water, and a taller friend who could see the top of the water heater asked why my hot and cold were backwards. Now near the middle of October, I called about this, and when they fixed their reversal, they replaced my pop off valve because it was ragged. I call back in November because my drain is pouring cold water. They come back and replace the pop off and the thermostat saying it had been too high (imagine that: I had to turn the heater up because your idiots were mixing cold into my hot every time I turned it on), but then I told him it is still leaking, and it is still cold, and it is still from the VALVE THAT I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM WAS LEAKING AFTER HEARING IT THROUGH A STETHOSCOPE. One final visit, and they cut out the cold water overpressure drain pipe (that blew during the time it was hooked up wrong) and capped off the valve. The cap leaked in spite of the roll and a half of Teflon tape that they tried to squish into place, most not even wrapped in threads, just wrapped around the shank.\nIf you want a job done right *I* have to do it, I guess. Turns out that the valve has a proprietary fitting, and they just didn't want to pay to do the job right. How's that, Terry, when you charged me $400 to do everything wrong from the beginning? The owner is planning to run for mayor, and let me tell you: he is a perfect fit for the corrupt and crooked council in this town, overcharging for shoddy work, then auctioning off the work to someone else willing to work cheap and skimp on materials.\nCalling them is useless. You just have to wait until they call trying to get payment for a half-done job.\nI will NEVER do business with this company again.",

DO NOT use this company!!\nI paid this company in full over a thousand dollars in work when I moved into my home to have them replace my breaker panel box. When I had my inspection I was told the main thing I needed to have replaced in the home was that box because it was unsafe for my children and I . I called this company and they came out and worked on it and put a new one in for me.  Long story short the last two days I've been having very strange things happening with my electricity.  My fridge going out, my stove, my lights in my home. My tv turning on and off. I had a another person here working on my kitchen sink and he checked out the inside of the box for me and there's still old original unsafe wiring that I had paid that company to replace still in the box. I called the craig plumbing and electrical company and told him, (his name is Terry) about what was going on. He came about a hour ago checked it out and refused to do anything about it , would not take accountability for it, tried to blame me for the issue's. I'm a single mother with three girl's,  I know nothing about electrical work! That's Why I paid I thought were professionals to fix/ replace the issue.   And no one has touched that box since they worked on it. So I just want to warn people to be careful.",

The pvc pipe they glued in is still working and they assure me they'll repair it if it fails but I doubt they could have messed up gluing a pvc pipe.

Unfortunately from day one, our home had plumbing issues. We were having to drive 30 minutes back and forth to a family member\u2019s house just to use the restroom.\n\nFinally, after several calls to plumbers in the YellowPages that weren\u2019t nice nor eager to assist (one even hung up on me). Till finally I spoke with Mrs. Sue at Jordan Electric. She was kind, empathetic, and even though they were short staffed she let me know she would do what she could to help! Within an hour she called back and let me know that they would be out first thing tomorrow morning (today), and even apologized again for our wait.\n\nMr. Jordan and the other gentlemen were efficient and friendly as all get out! They showed my husband and I what to look for in the septic piping so we knew for the future. Within an hour- my toilets worked!!!! They got the giant clog out. Mr. J did let me know this may be an ongoing issue due to plumbing being done incorrectly but quite frankly I didn\u2019t even mind because of how kind they were to us! I plan on even having him coming back for electric issues we\u2019re having too.\n\nWe are blessed to have found such a great company in the area that can help us!\n\nThank you Jordan Electric! \ud83d\udc9b",

They came out and got the shower to work. He mentioned that he has to program the valve to make sure it doesn't come out boiling hot (which I would assume ai would still get hot water at least.) My step mom was asking the guy questions and he was getting very short with her and annoyed. I could literally see it in his facial expressions and hear the short responses snipping responses he gave her. After all was said and done I got a call for the payment from a woman and they wanted to charge me another $200 stating that they crawled under the house (the guy wasn't even dirty bc trust me my dad went under there and he was filthy) so she was arguing and said the guy never lies..but doesn't  necessarily mean she was saying i was lying...yeah sure...so I didn't get anywhere with that but even after paying $832 I have no hot water coming out of my shower. This experience was horrible and they are a rip off to people. Never will use their services ever again.

Through luck, I was told about James and Absolute Instruments and Electrical and he was able to troubleshoot the issues cause by the first electrician not properly grounding the structure at the breaker box. He fixed the issues then went out of his way and sent me links with his recommendations for replacements for all of the fixtures inside the house that had been fried due to the first electricians shoddy job.\n\nThey also connected and established power to my other tiny house.

        "text": "I had Mr. Holcomb and his crew work on my bathroom. Here are the issues I had with this contractor: it took him nearly 40 days to get to the job, after I gave him over half of the money to \"get to the job\" and numerous calls to see when he would start \"; upon completion of the job, he relayed it is all finished and I mailed him a check for the remainder of the amount as per what his contract and verbal discussions agreed to; being as this is a rental property I assumed (bad bad bad) all was good after talking to him (Holcomb) and my tenant. . .upon arrival at my property, I saw a job that was half way properly done. . staples half way in the wood, framing boards ripped and not painted (thus allowing water to touch and will rot) framing / overlap pieces cut too short and one piece not even going from ceiling to floor leaving at least 6 inches of a gap and probably the biggest item, no caulking used on the tub / shower at the top and bottom of the unit. Folks I could go on with the list of discrepancies but if you are using him, I suggest you are there to watch and ensure your points you have agreed and paid for are met to your approval.  In closing, I will be filing a complaint against him via the BBB. It is a shame that I have paid thousands for such a bad / poorly job when he came highly recommended. Update 22 May I rec'd notification from BBB and they said Mr. Holcomb did not respond to the calls or letters they sent. I asked BBB what could be done now and they relayed it would have to go to court. So in short, if you have an issue with a \"provider of a service\" and expect the BBB to do anything, well perhaps it will work for you and secondly, Mr. Holcomb I do hope that you treat future clients (if you get any) better than you did me on the job I paid you for. People, beware.",

I needed my ice and water hooked up for my new refrigerator he came the next day to look at my hook ups and followed up the next day to fix it! He explained everything very clearly. Super nice, professional and understanding.  A little pricey but in all fairness everything has become so pricey. He did eagerly show up to get the job done, right!\nI plan on calling on him for a couple other jobs! Thanks Jay \ud83d\ude01",

I would never do business with Patrick\u2019s again and highly recommend against it.  They even tried to tow our truck without removing the driveshaft.  Luckily the dealer warned us about them, I just didn\u2019t think they would screw us this bad.  When I talked to them to discuss the bill they lied and said they told me and it is what it is.\n\nI told them I was writing this review and I hope they sleep well at night taking advantage of truckers.\n\n*****stay away*****\n\n***EDIT the plot thickens.

        "text": "The head of Current Electric Solutions coordinated the electrical wiring for my new home. It was a huge electrical job requiring 3 electrical panels on two floors. We have been in the house for over a year and discovered no electrical problems. Lights don't dim when the HVAC comes on! Plugging in a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner doesn't flip a circuit breaker off. These issues plagued me in the last house we had built, so I had experienced a terrible electrical install. The electrician on our recent job labeled all the circuits properly using terms I could recognize. Lights were laser sited with perfection. We did a personal walk through to fully discuss specific light locations and heights, prior install. They obviously knew what they were doing and we benefited from their experience.\n\nWe thought so highly of their work that I asked them to help install new lighting at another location. It was in high rise structure made of thick reinforced concrete. Current Electric Solutions had to \"think out of the box\" to create an attractive way to install an electric box that met code AND looked attractive. It was not easy, but as the name indicates they found a Current Electric SOLUTION. I appreciate the fore thought required to make it happen.\n\nThe head of the company knows electricity up, down and sideways. He is honest and dependable. We are satisfied repeat customers, so I feel confident in recommending them to my neighbors.",

I had an electrician come install some lights and fans when we moved in and they found a bunch of hot wires that do not turn off  when the switch is turned off. My carriage lights didn\u2019t work and we opened up the switch panel and the wire is just hanging in the wall and wasn\u2019t long enough to make it to the switch. Cross wiring all across the house, I\u2019ll turn my daughters fan off in the room and the bathroom lights will turn on. None of my Deako lighting works properly they flash like strobe lights when trying to dim them. It\u2019s not just my house they\u2019ve came and corrected a few of my neighbors houses with the same issues. They just won\u2019t come address mine because another electrician found their shoddy work. They have ZERO INTEGRITY, DR Horton has put multiple work orders in for them to come out and fix these issues and they just ignore them.",

From the moment he arrived, it was clear that he was a true professional\u2014punctual, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable.\n\nThe installation was done flawlessly, with Joseph taking the time to explain every step of the process and ensuring that everything was up to code. He was meticulous in his work, paying attention to every detail, and the result was a clean, efficient setup that works perfectly.\n\nWhat really stood out was his commitment to safety and quality. He double-checked all the connections and even gave me a thorough walkthrough of how to use the charger effectively. His expertise gave me complete confidence that the job was done right.\n\nAnd to top it all off, his pricing was the best in town! I did my research beforehand, and master electrician offered the most competitive rate without compromising on quality.\n\nIf you're looking for an electrician who is not only skilled but also genuinely cares about delivering top-notch service at a great price, I highly recommend master electrician, I will definitely be calling him for any future electrical needs. Thank you for making my Tesla charging experience so seamless!",

They recently took care of my air conditioning issues, and everything was handled quickly, professionally, and with great attention to detail. What sets them apart is their dedication to customer service and communication. Dustin was always available to answer questions and address my AC needs, even after hours.\n\nFrom start to finish, he kept me informed every step of the way, making the entire process smoother than I expected. The company\u2019s strong leadership is evident in both the quality of their work and the positive attitude of their technicians. If you need an AC team that\u2019s reliable, skilled, and truly puts their customers first, Dustin and his crew are the ones to call. Highly recommend!\n\n\u2013 T.B., Fairhope Homeowner",

We had an urgent HVAC need that occurred right when my elderly father had a major health crisis and decline and was still living in the house with the A/C problems.  Dustin and A/C Pros was recommended to us for a second pro opinion and he personally answered my call immediately, and was at my house the next day to give us his honest and thorough opinion and advice. I could tell immediately upon meeting him that he was experienced, highly motivated, intentional and thoughtful about wanting to help us get to the root of our issue. All things I would hope for from a service professional. But what\nhe didn\u2019t realize was that we had been working with other companies who didn\u2019t respond in the same, professional and prompt and thorough way, and with the stress of my dad\u2019s health decline simultaneously happening with his home\u2019s A/C issues, we were desperate for a prompt, but also kind, thoughtful and helpful professional to swoop in and get our issues resolved quickly! And that\u2019s what we got from Dustin and we\u2019re just so grateful! A/C Pros not only helped us fix the issues quickly, but they did it with care. Don\u2019t hesitate to call them!",
