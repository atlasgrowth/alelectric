      "Israel and his team did a fantastic job with the install of our crown molding, baseboards, and light fixture hanging.  They did so well that my husband and I are hiring them back for other work.  We have worked with many contractors during our home remodel, but they have been the best by far, and completed the job in a timely manner.  I highly recommend them - and look forward to working with them again.  It’s a relief to come across a quality working team.",

With more rain on the way, they came and fixed it on Sunday.  Showed up on time, worked efficiently and made the repairs for the estimate price given.  Cleaned up all leftover materials and were mindful of our kids and dogs.  I would happily have them back for other home repair/remodeling.",

Technician was here by 11:20, problem was fixed by 12! We had gotten a different plumber to look at the issue a few days prior and he had quoted me almost 2k to fix the issue. Snipes came out and fixed the issue for $160!! Technician that came out was super quick and very knowledgeable about what he was doing! If we ever have another issue I will 100% call Snipes again!

He had all the necessary parts needed and worked with me for the best placement of the box.  He was efficient and left the area cleaner than it was when he arrived.\n\nI used A-1 a couple of years ago for a problem in the same out-building.  Turned out to be a loose breaker.  Didn't have a problem  with his service then either - which is why I called him for my new circuit.\n\nI've been thinking about going solar and found out Leonard is also very knowledgeable about solar. After he installed my RV circuit we discussed what would be needed and a very rough estimate so I could get an idea of the costs.  If/when I decide to make the Solar plunge I'll be calling Leonard for a more comprehensive estimate. I've spoken to a Solar Company in Birmingham and they were a joke.  Their prices were outrageous and got to the point they wouldn't return phone calls.  I got the complete opposite with A-1.\n\nLeonard is no nonsense and ethical and will tell you like it is.

He came back out for free and after proving the problem wasn't related to his work, he recommended replacing the water heater, and explained how to do it.

I could not recommend him more highly.",

We had a lightning claim at our home that caused extensive damage to our panel box, wiring, applicances, etc.  (Our home is a 100-year-old home that probably needed some updating in the electrical and plumbing areas, frankly).  I had heard nothing but rave reviews about Semi-Retiired Electrician, so I contacted him.  Mr. Turgeon's response time was surprisingly fast.  He was courteous and punctual...two of the things that rate highly with me.  I was also impressed with his ability to assess the damage and explain how he would make repairs that would be BETTER THAN the existing electrical codes.  He began work at our home the next day because we were completely without electricity.  As he worked, I had the opportunity to talk with him and was further impressed to know that he is a retired electrical engineer that just loves to work rather than live the retired life.  The entire job lasted about three days (but he got the electricity back on the first day, thankfully!).  As he would find wires, junction boxes, splices, etc. that were fire hazards or \"out of code\", he would fix them...with my prior consent, of course.  I'll never forget what the county electrical inspector said when I called to schedule the inspection of Mr. Turgeon's work.  He asked who the contractor was, and I told him Semi-Retired Electrician.  He said, \"Well, it won't take long to inspect.  He does excellent work.\"  I agree.I would definitely recommend him to any and everyone.",

We were told by the phone companies they don't do repairs on inside lines anymore and that electricians now have to do that. So I stopped in at Univeristy Electric on Monday and talked to them about this. They were so nice and said they would be glad to come out and fix it. That they would put us on the wait list and call when they had an opening. Tuesday morning at 8:15am I got a call from them that they could come out this morning if it was ok with us. Wow, that was fast. So Thomas came out to see what needed to be done to fix the issue, got the right stuff, spent a couple of hours running a new line and fixed our issue. Thomas was very nice, friendly and professional. He checked several other things dealing with the phone connection. He made sure we were happy with everything and also made us aware of other services that available through his company. So have no doubts we will definitely use them again!!

They only followed the electrical plans provided by the builder. Issues we had with lighting were due to the fans having remotes and not traditional pull chords. I never knew that could make a difference in how the ceiling fans operated.\n\nAt any rate, A-1 sent out one of their electrical supervisors. He replaced an outlet for me and replaced a suspected “weak”electrical relay with no issues. Phillip also explained everything to me, then relayed my concerns to the company management.\n\nThe owners reached out to me and have agreed to work with me to resolve my issues and get things the way I want. I had a long talk with the owner and she is genuine and truly wants to do the right thing. Thank you team A-1!!  I’m more than satisfied with the results.  😎😎",

Long story short the guy that came out from A 1 was fast very friendly and more than knowledgeable and helpful. Every experience is different but for me it was great... I wish that the rest of the build went as smooth as it did with this guy."

Our main line was clogged and Day Plumbing returned our call the next day after we called and came out that afternoon. Danny and a Jimmy was a welcome site and got to work right away to unblock the clogged drain line. After the first pass, they waited around to ensure the clog was cleared, but it started backing up again.  So they ran their equipment again and cleared the line again. Said it was because of the heating and cooling of the grease in the line that it sometimes causes repeated clearing. After running hot water down the drain for an extended period of time, the drain appears to be working fine. While waiting to ensure water didn’t back up again, Danny and Jimmy went the extra mile and cleaned our bathroom and shower drains as I was concerned they might be getting clogged up. All in all, they did a great job and at a reasonable cost, and were very timely with coming out to fix the drain. Oh, would be remiss if I didn’t mention great customer service that Jeanette provided over the phone. Thank you Day Plumbing.",

I contacted a large plumbing company in Montgomery, but they recommended Danny Day and told me he does quality work at a price that would be considerably lower than theirs.  How right they were.  He persisted until he found and replaced a faulty pressure regulator and also found and repaired a long-standing leak in a copper pipe.  Our water pressure is now better than it has ever been.  His charge was considerably less than I was expecting and probably a third of what one of the large companies would have charged.  He is an old-fashioned plumber who treats his customers the way he would want to be treated.  I recommend him highly.",

Additionally, well explained how to avoid this damage from happening again.\n\nHis professionalism and customer acknowledgement and passion for his craft should be the standard for the industry.\n\nThis was my 1st time experience with James Bishop and I can't thank him enough.

Austin, the plumber on the ground, offers a price range, but Cesar, the manager, makes the final tweaks over the phone as you start to dissect the cost per service/item. Once you get past that, you'll struggle to find a team with a more extensive toolkit at their disposal. On one occasion, I had three vans of plumbers at my property. So, you definitely receive value for your investment. It's a relationship based on mutual understanding. Despite the initial hurdles, I wouldn't want anyone else handling my plumbing needs. If you're okay with asking questions and putting in some effort, these guys, under new management now, will undoubtedly exceed your expectations.",
      "Austin and Cesar from Roy's Plumbing Repairs were fantastic! They were patient with me when I was delayed from work. They put in extra effort to navigate around the protective skunk barrier installed around my plumbing system due to a previous skunk issue. They were courteous, respectful, and communicated with me in a professional manner, unlike some maintenance men who tend to talk down to women. They tidied up the area nicely and inspected all the pipes and faucets thoroughly. It was reassuring to have plumbers who were competent and willing to go above and beyond to satisfy their client. They were so excellent, I wished I could have given them some gift cards for dinner! I also had another gentleman from Roy's Plumbing Repairs come out to inspect my outdoor faucet in Montgomery. I'm embarrassed I can't remember his name, but he was also exceptional. He wasn't aggressive or pushy to conduct unnecessary repairs like some can be. Such wonderful guys all around! Thank you so much!",
      "austin was professional, efficient, and friendly when it came to our plumbing needs. he dedicated time to understand our desires and concerns regarding the installation. we were thoroughly impressed with the services provided by roy's plumbing repairs, as well as the advice and recommendations austin gave. after the job was completed, he cleaned up meticulously and took the time to ensure we were satisfied with every detail of the work. from replacing the pipes to installing two new faucets, we were very impressed. thank you, montgomery's finest!",
      "austin and cesar from richards family plumbing & electrical were polite, well-informed, and efficient! they promptly helped us out of a tricky predicament. they clearly outlined the problem, detailed their planned solution, and ensured everything was functioning smoothly before they departed. i highly recommend reaching out to them in montgomery for trustworthy and reasonable plumbing services.",
      "Cesar from Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical was prompt in arriving at my place in Montgomery over the weekend to tackle the stubborn blockage in my sewer line. The work was carried out outdoors and when Cesar needed to fetch an additional tool, he graciously paused the time to ensure I wasn't overcharged. The entire task was handled professionally and cordially. Under their new management, Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical is delivering excellent service. I highly endorse them!",
      "austin from richards family plumbing & electrical turned up punctually, demonstrated impressive knowledge and maintained a friendly demeanor. he did excellent plumbing work and his cleanup was impeccably neat. i would definitely propose this company to others as they excel in their work. the service was premium quality from start to finish.",
      "Austin from Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical was incredibly helpful and provided a wealth of information during his visit. I had asked him about using a camera for the inspection, as I was informed that it was included in the price. Austin explained that he didn't have the camera with him, but assured me that either he or Cesar would return later that day or by Monday at the latest to complete the task. Under their new management, Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical has made great strides in customer service and I received a prompt follow-up call to ensure everything was in order. Their commitment to delivering quality plumbing services in Montgomery is truly commendable.",
      "I am thoroughly pleased. The administrative team at Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical managed my call, estimated the cost, and set up an agreeable time to carry out the project with utmost professionalism. Austin arrived promptly, exuding an air of professionalism. He completed the task swiftly and efficiently. The job was executed perfectly, maintaining cleanliness throughout. I would certainly endorse them and will not hesitate to engage their services again in the future in Montgomery!",
      "Cesar and his partner (apologies, i forget his name!) were a great help, and showed their professionalism. They were engaged with the job at Richards Family Plumbing & Electrical when they encountered an unforeseen issue with an aging tap. however, they managed to resolve it as advised. overall, their charges were reasonable, and they were quick and professional in Montgomery."

(It wasn’t the compressor.)\nMy wife and I were very impressed with Mark's knowledge, skills and professionalism.

I have tried to call numerous times to see what the problem was, but no one will respond. I guess that he assumes that his time is more valuable than mine. Lesson learned, I won’t be calling or recommending this company to anyone!",

While he was checking on the trim job I asked him if he knew someone for a cabinet job not knowing he also did that as well. From start to finish Slade was a man of his word unlike multiple other Montgomery contractors who I have been burned by. He made it clear to expect some touch up needed and until I was satisfied he sent his crew everyday until it was up to my standards. He also tried to save me money with different ways of doing things which is unheard of which I truly appreciated. I will be using him for all my jobs going forward and he is a gem for this area. Thank you Slade and his team for a great job.",

Scheduled them for the next day. However, they had a cancellation and asked if they could come that day to do the work. Showed up with 15 minutes of that call and got right to the demolition and repairs.  I needed to have the fascia board on the back of my house replaced and an exterior door frame fixed from water damage. They replaced the fascia board with MiraTech which has a much longer life than wood.  Work was completed within a few hours and it looks great! Their team is definitely someone I would recommend for any repairs that you are needing. Price was super good and their professionalism was too notch.",

The owner stated they were starting a power wash business as well and quoted me a price for my driveway and stone walkway.

He has been out several times now and has fixed so much bad wiring, run new wires, put in a new panel, added new circuits, etc.\nI can’t say enough how grateful we are to have found him."

But when I had to call him a second time to come unclog the toilet, I knew that it was just time to replace it. I talked to him about installing a new toilet, got a quote, and expected to have to wait at least a week or more before he would be able to get back out to put in the new toilet, but nope! He was back two days later and had the new toilet installed in a little more than an hour! I would not hesitate to recommend him to family, friends, and strangers.

They made sure I understood all my options clearly before drafting my invoice. Once the paperwork was done they got to work immediately. Even though my situation was a little more complex than the average swap out, they problem solved quickly and got everything installed within a few hours, and took the time to show me how everything worked. They even had to reconfigure my washer and dryer set up to accommodate the new water heater, and they didn’t leave until they ensured everything was working as it should for me. I’ll be recommending them to anyone I know with plumbing issues and I’ll be a return customer in the future for sure! Thanks again Tristan and Nathaniel!",

My sump pump was not working, he identified the problem quickly. My float had gone bad, he replaced the float with one he had at his shop so there was no ordering parts. Works perfectly now, he even took the time to fix one of my toliets. He was very professional and just a really nice guy. The price was better than I expected especially with the time and effort it took. Will definitely be using his services in the future.",

Not only was he willing to meet me that morning, but he also uncovered an issue that the previous company did not spot. Thanks to them, I was able to factor this into negotiations for closing. Both Kris and the guy who helped him with the sewer scope were super professional and nice. I will definitely reach out to them to fix the issues in the next few weeks. I highly recommend Kris n Co."

I will continue to be a long time customer and would recommend them to anyone. As others have mentioned when you call their business number you do get a voice mail greeting that instructs you to call Lance and gives you another phone number to call, so just have a pen and paper handy. Lance will call you back within a reasonable amount of time and is so easy to talk to. Just make sure you don't miss his call! I made that mistake the first time I needed them and missed the first opening they had to come out. They are very good and very busy and since I missed his call he moved on to the next customer on his list.  I had to wait a couple days because I missed out but I understood and it was fine because it wasn't an emergency. Both times they came out Brian was my service provider. He is very nice and so knowledgeable and also very easy to talk to! He will tell you the best options for your issues, where the best deals are and what to buy if it makes more sense to do so, and will give great advice for any questions you have. Their prices are also very very very reasonable and they do not take advantage of people. We had an extra electrical line installed and it was run through our attic to the outside and it looks so good that you would think the house was built with it originally. I also had him do some work under my kitchen sink and his assistant that came out with him vacuumed the debris in the cabinet when they were done! I was very impressed.

Frank went above and beyond assisting to get the salt generator working. I highly recommend him and his company. I had randomly picked his company off of a Google search. I am glad I found his company.",
      "I'd  recommend him to anyone,he came after hours wired my hot water heater for me got me out of a jam.",
      "Mr. Frank King came at the last minute and help my husband and I. We had been trying to get some electrical work done in our home and NO one would come or they were too busy🙄 Praise God, Frank answer the call and came right out. Will ALWAYS have our business!!!",
      "Wonderful service. I needed outside outlets, a switch and a garage outlet changed out.  Service was outstanding! Very efficient, knowledgeable and professional.   Will be who I call for any electrical work or concerns.  Would recommend him to anyone.",
      "I had family coming in from out of state and they needed to plug in their travel trailer.  I called on Saturday and he was here on Monday evening.  The price was reasonable.  He listened to our needs and explained the options we had available to him.  Definitely plan on using him again.\n\n***UPDATE 9/22/2022\nCalled again to tell him a light switch was sizzling in my kitchen and he came out same day.  I tried to book an appointment to have him install some kitchen lighting and he offered to do it while he was at my home.  He stayed late to complete the job.  Love my new lights.  I will always use this company.",
      "We had been dealing with flickering lights, partial power and no AC and couldn't find the problem. We called and spoke to Frank who came that afternoon even though he was on another service call. It wasn't long before he found the problem and he stayed until the job was done. Our house could have burned down. He basically saved our lives. Not only is he a wonderful electrician, he cares about his customers. I definitely recommend Frank to anyone having electrical issues!",
      "Frank was super nice to my family and I. He did an outstanding job helping install my Ring doorbell and fixed my wires. I'm glad we came across your business! I look forward to working with you again! Thank you again for being so kind! If you're looking for a knowledgeable electrician, I highly recommend Frank!",
      "We feel fortunate to have  King Construction and Electric do our electrical work. Frank is a good, honest and professional person. Our house is only 2 yrs old, but the outlets in the kitchen kept melting if more than one gadget was running at the same time. He ran some type of higher voltage wiring and now we have more designated circuits. He also installed a garbage disposal and wired an electrical outlet for it and then installed an outdoor fan. It was a two day job and it was so worth the money to now feel safe have peace of mind.",
      "Frank is an amazing and great electrician. My family and I we're having outages on one side of our house, not only did he diagnose the problem quickly, he explained in understandable terms what the issues were and how to prevent them for the future. Very affordable and even came late into the night so as to prevent anything more severe from happening. Highly reccomend and will definitely use moving forward! Thank you Frank!",

Also (mostly) cleaned up after themselves, didn't leave a huge mess for me to deal with.

Till finally I spoke with Mrs. Sue at Jordan Electric. She was kind, empathetic, and even though they were short staffed she let me know she would do what she could to help! Within an hour she called back and let me know that they would be out first thing tomorrow morning (today), and even apologized again for our wait.\n\nMr. Jordan and the other gentlemen were efficient and friendly as all get out! They showed my husband and I what to look for in the septic piping so we knew for the future. Within an hour- my toilets worked!!!! They got the giant clog out. Mr. J did let me know this may be an ongoing issue due to plumbing being done incorrectly but quite frankly I didn’t even mind because of how kind they were to us!

He fixed the issues then went out of his way and sent me links with his recommendations for replacements for all of the fixtures inside the house that had been fried due to the first electricians shoddy job.\n\nThey also connected and established power to my other tiny house. Everything was done safely and professionally. Communications was great every step of the way, which I greatly appreciated since I do not live locally.

Plugging in a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner doesn't flip a circuit breaker off. These issues plagued me in the last house we had built, so I had experienced a terrible electrical install. The electrician on our recent job labeled all the circuits properly using terms I could recognize. Lights were laser sited with perfection. We did a personal walk through to fully discuss specific light locations and heights, prior install. They obviously knew what they were doing and we benefited from their experience.\n\nWe thought so highly of their work that I asked them to help install new lighting at another location. It was in high rise structure made of thick reinforced concrete. Current Electric Solutions had to \"think out of the box\" to create an attractive way to install an electric box that met code AND looked attractive. It was not easy, but as the name indicates they found a Current Electric SOLUTION.

But what\nhe didn’t realize was that we had been working with other companies who didn’t respond in the same, professional and prompt and thorough way, and with the stress of my dad’s health decline simultaneously happening with his home’s A/C issues, we were desperate for a prompt, but also kind, thoughtful and helpful professional to swoop in and get our issues resolved quickly! And that’s what we got from Dustin and we’re just so grateful! A/C Pros not only helped us fix the issues quickly, but they did it with care. Don’t hesitate to call them!",
      "Late night call due to our AC going out, Dustin answered immediately. He got us on the schedule early the next day and diagnosed our issue and the compressor had failed. He gave us multiple options to repair or buy a new AC unit without any pressure. Thankfully Dustin identified the compressor was still under warranty and I made the decision to replace the compressor. The best customer service in a market where most are out to upsell. Thanks!!",
      "A/CPro was recommended to me  and Dustin responded.\nHad to order a coil in the blower and his team was able to replace the coil in blower the next day.\nWow, Thank you!!\nHighly recommended\nA/C PROS\nYou can't go wrong :)",
      "Our outside unit stoped working, we called at 8:30pm and they had a tech arrive at 9pm. The tech was great! Had us up and running in less than 30 min. Great and honest company."
